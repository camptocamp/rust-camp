# Rust Guild

The `Rust Guild` is a [Camptocamp Special Interest Group](https://confluence.camptocamp.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=GS&title=Guilds) and the organisation behind this book and associated repository.

Chat with us in the [#gs-guild-rust](https://camptocamp.slack.com/archives/C031P235MR8) Slack channel.

## Topic

The main topic of the guild is `The Rust Programming Language`. Some focus areas are Webassembly and the OGC API standards.

## Goal

* Explore and evaluate potential novel use cases to leverage Rust.
* Communicate and promote existing projects, capabilities and use cases.
